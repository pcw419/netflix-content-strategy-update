# netflix-content-strategy-update
Updated analysis of Netflix content strategy using title-level data up to 2025.

## Introduction


## Research Questions
This project focuses on the following questions:

1. Has Netflix shifted its content composition from movies toward TV shows over time?
2. Has Netflix’s content portfolio become more global in terms of production countries?
3. Have movie runtimes changed, reflecting shifts in content consumption patterns?

## Data

### Background

This project builds on insights from a team project completed in 2022
for the CDS 301 (Introduction to Data Science) course.
The original repository focused on exploratory visualization and interpretation.

## Methodology

## Key Findings

### Q1: Movies vs TV Shows  
- Netflix’s content additions have maintained a relatively balanced composition between movies and TV shows over time.
- On a monthly basis, both categories generally account for approximately 40–60% of total titles added, indicating no strong dominance by either format.
- While short-term fluctuations are visible, these variations appear to be driven by release timing and batch updates rather than a long-term strategic shift.
- Anomalies observed in the most recent periods are likely influenced by incomplete or uneven data coverage, rather than reflecting an actual change in Netflix’s content strategy.

### Q2: Globalization  
- Netflix established a globally diverse production network early in its expansion phase, with content produced across a wide range of countries from the beginning.
- Over time, the number of production countries does not show a consistent upward trend, suggesting a shift from geographic expansion to stabilization and strategic adjustment.
- Movies are produced across a broader set of countries than TV shows, indicating that films are used as a flexible channel for experimenting with new markets and regional content.
- TV shows exhibit a more stable and concentrated production pattern, reflecting higher investment costs and a preference for proven markets.
- Overall, Netflix’s globalization strategy appears to have evolved from rapid expansion toward selective diversification and portfolio optimization rather than continuous geographic growth.

## Limitations  

### Q1
Because this dataset contains a fixed number of movie and TV titles for each release year, it does not allow for meaningful analysis of absolute growth in Netflix’s content volume over time. Instead, this analysis emphasizes changes in relative composition and proportional trends between movies and TV shows.

### Q2
This analysis uses the number of distinct production countries as a proxy for globalization, which captures geographic breadth but not the volume or intensity of production in each country. As a result, all countries are weighted equally regardless of their actual contribution, and co-productions are not fully distinguished. The findings therefore reflect the breadth of Netflix’s global reach rather than the depth of production in specific regions.
